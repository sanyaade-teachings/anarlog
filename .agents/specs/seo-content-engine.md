# Anarlog SEO Content Engine

Last updated: 2026-07-09 KST.

This is the operating note for autonomous Anarlog blog work. It complements
`apps/web/content/AGENTS.md`, which remains the source of truth for positioning
and voice.

## Goal

Use Anarlog's existing SEO traction to drive acquisition. Ship genuinely useful
posts on a steady cadence, refresh posts that are close to ranking wins, and
keep blog media clean in Supabase.

Anarlog is the SEO-led acquisition product. Char/Charpedia content should remain
founder/product/category narrative unless explicitly requested otherwise.

## Cadence

- Publish or refresh on a natural 1-2 day gap when we have something genuinely
  useful to ship.
- Schedule each next post randomly 1 or 2 days after the latest published/dated
  post. If the latest post is dated today, count from today.
- Do not publish thin, generic, or mechanically padded posts just to hit
  cadence. If the content is not helpful, skip the slot and reset from the next
  real publish date.
- Default rolling mix:
  - Top-of-funnel posts or refreshes for meeting workflows, privacy, and
    category education.
  - Conversion posts or refreshes for competitor alternatives and
    platform-specific pages.
  - Landing-page-support or strategic refresh posts when they strengthen
    conversion paths.

## Post Types

- Top of funnel: educational/category-intent posts that capture meeting workflow
  searches before readers are vendor-comparing.
- Conversion: competitor alternatives, platform-specific notetaker pages, and
  pages that compare tools while routing readers toward Anarlog's private,
  local-first, bot-free positioning.
- Do not end posts with generic `Related reading` or `Sources` sections. Put
  useful internal links and source references contextually near the claims or
  sections they support.

## Narrative Arc

Lead with privacy for prosumers and individuals, then bridge that trust into an
enterprise security narrative.

- Prosumer/individual entry point: "I want useful AI meeting notes without
  handing every sensitive conversation to a random cloud bot."
- Team expansion point: "If privacy matters this much for my own meetings, it
  matters even more for my team's internal discussions."
- Enterprise bridge: "Anarlog is built for organizations that care about data
  privacy, meeting security, and user-controlled workflows."

Content should make this progression feel natural:

- Start with user-level privacy, local-first control, bot-free capture, and
  sensitive meeting use cases.
- Add team-level workflows around shared meeting memory, controlled access, and
  less social friction in calls.
- Later, build enterprise pages around security, data handling, compliance
  posture, deployment controls, and procurement-ready trust materials.

Do not make enterprise claims before the product and proof points support them.
Use "privacy-first" and "security-conscious" as the bridge until formal
enterprise security assets are ready.

## Keyword Workflow

- Use Semrush as the source for keyword and SERP research. Do not fall back to
  Ahrefs.
- Prefer US Semrush data unless a post has an explicit regional target.
- Record the keyword, volume, KD, current Anarlog position when available, and
  target URL in Linear or the PR body.
- Prioritize:
  - Existing Anarlog URLs ranking positions 8-20 for meaningful keywords.
  - Low-KD competitor-alternative terms with clear commercial intent.
  - Platform pages where Anarlog already has a relevant article.
  - Strategic privacy/local/bot-free terms when they strengthen category
    positioning, even if exact volume is small.

## Competitor Tracking

Track both product competitors and SERP competitors.

Primary product competitors:

- Otter.ai
- Fireflies.ai
- tl;dv
- Read.ai
- Granola
- Plaud AI
- Fathom
- Tactiq
- Jamie
- Notta
- Noota
- Meetily

SERP/content competitors to watch opportunistically:

- Zapier
- Microsoft
- Zoom
- Reddit
- YouTube
- Product review sites and app marketplaces

Current pattern from July 2026 research:

- Otter, Fireflies, Read, and Fathom increasingly message around AI agents,
  workflow automation, meeting knowledge, and CRM/productivity integrations.
- Granola, Jamie, Fathom, Tactiq, and tl;dv now all have some form of bot-free
  or no-bot messaging, so Anarlog should not rely on "bot-free" alone.
- Anarlog's sharper angle should combine bot-free capture with privacy,
  local-first/user-controlled workflows, and genuinely useful meeting memory.
- The acquisition narrative should begin with privacy for individuals and
  prosumers, then mature into enterprise security and organizational data
  privacy as teams adopt it.
- Competitor blogs are publishing a mix of product updates, SEO comparison
  pages, platform/how-to content, privacy/security explainers, and role/workflow
  guides.

Research each competitor before writing conversion content:

- Homepage positioning and current headline.
- Blog/content hub categories.
- Comparison/alternatives pages they already rank with.
- Privacy/security claims.
- Bot/no-bot behavior.
- Integrations and workflow promises.
- Any recent launch that changes the comparison.

## Current First-Cycle Targets

- Top-of-funnel refresh: `meeting-minutes-software`
  - Primary keyword: `meeting minutes software`
  - Semrush signal: volume 1000, KD 39, Anarlog around position 11 before
    refresh.
- Conversion refresh: `otter-ai-alternatives`
  - Primary keyword: `otter ai alternatives`
  - Semrush signal: volume 390, KD 28; variants include
    `otter.ai alternatives` and `alternatives to otter.ai`.
- Conversion refresh: `granola-ai-alternatives`
  - Primary keyword: `granola ai alternatives`
  - Semrush signal: volume 140, KD 13.
- Platform refresh: `best-ai-notetaker-for-microsoft-teams`
  - Primary keyword: `teams ai note taker`
  - Semrush signal: volume 590, KD 43, Anarlog around position 13.
- Platform refresh: `best-ai-notetaker-for-zoom`
  - Primary keyword: `ai notetaker for zoom`
  - Semrush signal: volume 260, KD 35.
- Strategic top-of-funnel:
  `bot-free-ai-meeting-assistants` or a privacy/local variant
  - Primary keywords: `local ai meeting notes`, `private ai notetaker`,
    `bot free ai notetaker`
  - Semrush signal: low/incomplete exact volume, but strong category
    positioning.

## Media Rules

- Cover images should use dynamic OG images. Do not restore stale static
  `cover.png` frontmatter references.
- Body images should live in Supabase Storage bucket `blog`.
- Canonical object path format: `articles/<slug>/<filename>`.
- MDX should reference proxied URLs:
  `/api/assets/blog/articles/<slug>/<filename>`.
- When touching a post, verify body image URLs are not 404/502.
- If existing reachable legacy media is found, copy it into the canonical path
  and update MDX links.

## Napkin Usage

- Use `pnpm --dir apps/web media:napkin` for conceptual diagrams, workflows,
  comparison visuals, and privacy/data-flow figures.
- Blog diagrams and conceptual figures should be generated with Napkin. Do not
  hand-roll custom SVG/PNG diagrams for blog content unless the user explicitly
  asks for a non-Napkin asset.
- Use Anarlog's Napkin brand ID by default:
  `CDQPRVVJCSTPRBBCD5Q6AWSDE8S0`.
- Napkin URLs expire; always upload generated files to Supabase before using
  them in MDX.
- Do not use Napkin or other generation tools to fake product UI.

## Screenshot Policy

- Product UI screenshots must be real, current screenshots from the app,
  official assets, or user-provided captures.
- If screenshot resources are unavailable, ask for resources or remove the
  screenshot requirement for that section.
- Generated images are acceptable only for conceptual/non-UI visuals.

## Validation Before PR

For blog/content-only changes:

- `dprint check --config dprint.json <changed files>`
- `pnpm --dir apps/web typecheck`
- Verify referenced body images return `200` through the production asset proxy
  when they are already deployed assets.

For changes that affect scripts/routes/build behavior:

- Run the focused script test or `node --check` where applicable.
- Run `infisical run --projectId 87dad7b5-72a6-4791-9228-b3b86b169db1 --path /anarlog/web --env prod -- pnpm --dir apps/web build` when a full web build is needed.

## Tracking

Use the Linear project `Anarlog SEO & Content Engine` for task state.

Known current blockers:

- Semrush connector can report keyword/project data but cannot create or
  configure a Semrush project for `anarlog.so`.
- Some older posts have missing body screenshots. Do not fabricate product UI;
  ask for screenshots or remove/replace the image with a legitimate conceptual
  visual.
